MEE_iNEXT-3D (R code for graphics in MEE paper by Chao et al.)

R code is provided for plotting all figures in the paper "Measuring temporal change in alpha diversity: a framework integrating taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and the iNEXT-3D standardization", Methods in Ecology and Evolution. Before using the R code, you must download the package "iNEXT-3D" from Anne Chao's Github. 

The data used for examples are based on the four-decade time series of estuarine fishes collected at Bridgwater Bay in UKâ€™s Bristol Channel from 1981 to 2019 using consistent sampling schemes; see Henderson and Holmes (1991), Magurran and Henderson (2003), and Henderson et al. (2011) for sampling details.  

"MEE_iNEXT-3D" includes the following files:

(1) Data for TD files: Alpine_relative_abundance_data: the relative abundances of the 45 Alpine species for three successional stages; see Figure 1.

(2) phylo_tree for PD: the phylogenetic tree of the 45 Alpine species; see Figure 1. This tree was taken from Ricotta et al. (2015, Appendix A).

(3) traits for FD 

(4) ????.R: Main code for plotting all figures (Figures 1 to 4 in the MEE paper).

(5) Lorenz.R: R code for computing and plotting the Lorenz curves of assemblages; see Appendix S4 for examples.
