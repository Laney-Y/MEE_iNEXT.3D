MEE_iNEXT.3D (R code for graphics in MEE 2021 paper by Chao et al.)

R code and data are provided for plotting all figures in the paper "Measuring temporal change in alpha diversity: a framework integrating taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and the iNEXT.3D standardization", Methods in Ecology and Evolution. Before using the R code, you must download the package "iNEXT.3D" from Anne Chao's Github. 

The data used for examples are based on the four-decade time series of estuarine fishes collected at Bridgwater Bay in UKâ€™s Bristol Channel from 1981 to 2019 using consistent sampling schemes; see Henderson and Holmes (1991), Magurran and Henderson (2003), and Henderson et al. (2011) for sampling details.  

"MEE_iNEXT.3D" includes the following files:

(1) Data Files: 
(1a) Abundance/incidence data: "Fish abundance data.csv" (for Figures 1, 2), "Fish incidence raw data.csv" and "Fish incidence frequency data.csv"(for Figures 3, 4) and "nT for incidence data.csv"(for Figures 3, 4). 
(1b) Phylogenetic tree for PD: "Fish phyloTree.txt" (for all figures).
(1c) Traits for FD: "Fish traits" (for all figures).

(2) Fish code.R: Main code for plotting all figures (Figures 1 to 4 in the MEE paper).

(3) Source R code: "Source R code.txt"

(4) Guide for R code: "Brief guide.docx" (details about some functions in iNEXT.3D and a brief guide to R code for making graphics in Chao et al. 2021 paper )
